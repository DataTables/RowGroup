<info><![CDATA[

Grouped information typically makes most sense when the table is also ordered by the data point that is being used to group the rows. In DataTables the `-init orderFixed` option can be used to define an ordering condition that will always be applied before the end user's own ordering.

In this example the table is always ordered by the _Office_ column first, but the end user has the option to order the data inside those groups as they required.
