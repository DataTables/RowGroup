<info><![CDATA[

This example shows RowGroup being used with the [Responsive extension](https://datatables.net/extensions/responsive) for DataTables. Responsive allows the table to dynamically grow and shrink as the page is resized, or loaded on browsers with different sizes of display.

As can be seen with this example, RowGroup and Responsive interact together exactly as would be expected, combining their respective functionality.
